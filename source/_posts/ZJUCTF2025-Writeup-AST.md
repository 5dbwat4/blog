**前排滑跪致歉：对不起给大家喂💩了**

# TL;DR

出这一题时设想的是出一道AI做不出来的题，如何做不出呢，那自然是token数得多；正好当时在干另外一个事情，就是将一个C代码转为AST，然后解析AST，进行一系列注入标识符替换，运算符提取，控制流展平等等一系列操作，输出一个等价但AST树几乎变样的C代码，用来绕过PTA的检测。

那么就有了这道题：将AST还原为C代码。

降低难度，直接运行还原后的代码会直接输出flag。

为了增加难度（防止根据loc信息直接把源代码还原出来），我们删除了`loc`,`range`,`name`信息，按理来说接下来就是人肉IDA的时间了。

预期的解法是：
1. 手写一个AST to C的脚本（应该是没有现成的工具的）
2. 输出每个节点的信息，手动肉眼看看（可能需要一点耐心，而且还很费眼，所以推荐第一种解法）

然后遇到了这两件事

1. 有人直接把JSON文件拖到Gemini里，然后就直接还原了（现在的AI已经发展到了一种我无法理解的水平.jpg）
2. clang生成的AST json文件里还有一个键，叫做`mangledName`，里面存储的是函数/全局变量的原始名字，那这直接看名字就能猜到里面在干什么了还逆个啥啊，导致预期第二种解法难度急剧下降。

总而言之这一题确实有点坏心眼在，然后玩的时候没玩好把自己绕进去了，导致出来的就是这么一道意义不明的题目。以后一定注意。
