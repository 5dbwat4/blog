<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:2em'><span style='font-family:Times New Roman'>Sir—I recently watched from the sidelines as the university committee charged with administering PhD degrees resolved a disagreement by external referees on the worth of a PhD thesis submitted by a student of mine.</span></p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:2em'><span style='font-family:Times New Roman'>One reviewer (from the United States) claimed the thesis provided insufficient advances in the field of study and declined support for the award of the degree, another (from the United Kingdom) judged the thesis excellent and requiring only minor amendments. The process required the judgement of a third external referee who returned a positive grading. The process prolonged the examination period, putting extra pressure on the candidate and raising the question of the nature of international standards for this type of degree.</span></p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:2em'><span style='font-family:Times New Roman'>The extremes were, I believe, symptomatic of different expectations by reviewers of acceptable thesis content—expectations that may reflect quite different perceptions of just <a name='_Hlk172135367'></a>what constitutes a PhD degree today. These may largely be related to the period expected for completion—in the United States often 5-6 years, in the United Kingdom up to 3 years. Some European countries expect up to 6 years. The trend in New Zealand is to require completion within 4 years.</span></p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:2em'><span style='font-family:Times New Roman'>As any biological scientist knows, the product of 6 years’ work is vastly different in scale from what may be achieved in 3 years. There is also a greater likelihood of published products within the longer time—a requirement of our negative examiner to obviate his concerns but one that would have prolonged the examination process by many months. Different international expectations must affect the external reviewing process used by most universities to protect the integrity of their higher degree.</span></p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:2em'><span style='font-family:Times New Roman'>Framing the PhD study to be conservative and guaranteed to yield desired results; directing the course of research to avoid difficult or more challenging areas as they arise; encouraging early publication of any completed work or even incomplete work and selecting external reviewers on the basis of certainty rather than risk a result based on open expectation—these are all strategies available to supervisory panels to counter possible criticism of thesis content, but most of them are surely contrary to the spirit of investigative science.</span></p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:2em'><span style=';font-family:Times New Roman'>Operating longer PhD programs best suits the universal PhD prescription requirements which require evidence of independent research and advance of knowledge, but is this the best way to encourage students into advanced science? A 6-year period may better suit the generation of results suitable for publication by the candidate, but it is surely too long as an apprenticeship for a science career. If the PhD degree is to be truly international as a qualification for postdoctoral, academic and industrial positions, reasonable boundaries are needed for the demonstration of both independence in research and advance of knowledge.</span></p><p><br/></p>

{% endraw %}

36. What was the main reason for the extended examination period of the student’s PhD thesis?
    A. Disagreement between the reviewers on the quality of the thesis.
    B. The requirement for additional amendments by the UK reviewer.
    C. Administrative delays in finalizing the evaluation process.
    D. Inadequate support from the university committee.
37. Why does the author mention different completion periods for PhD degrees in Paras. 3 and 4?
    A. To compare the efficiency of the PhD examination process in different countries.
    B. To question the inconsistency in PhD examination processes globally.
    C. To illustrate variations in expectations for PhD completion across countries.
    D. To highlight the challenges associated with getting a PhD degree.
38. What does the author think about the practices mentioned in Paragraph 5?
    A. They undermine the spirit of scientific inquiry.
    B. They facilitate unbiased evaluation by reviewers.
    C. They lead to incomplete research findings.
    D. They enhance the rigor of thesis content.
39. What does the passage suggest about longer PhD programs?
    A. They are necessary to protect the integrity of the PHD degree.
    B. They are the most effective way to encourage students into advanced science.
    C. They prioritize the quantity of research over the quality of research outcomes.
    D. They may prolong the period of apprenticeship unnecessarily for a science career.
40. What is the passage mainly about?
    A. The different international standards for completing a PhD degree.
    B. The benefits of a 6-year PhD program over shorter programs.
    C. The necessity of resolving disputes through a third referee.
    D. The importance of publishing research findings during a PhD program.

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:2em'><span style='font-family:Times New Roman'>Modern life is so noisy nowadays, it is the noisiest in the history; and with noise; many sounds are filtered out. As a result, we could end up missing some of the most important things in life. This can have far reaching implications, and is aptly known as “overstimulation.”</span></p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:2em'><span style='font-family:Times New Roman'>41) ______________Forget your smartphone, and your i7 chip set, the brain in your skull is the most efficient processor the world has ever known, capable of processing stimuli from a variety of sources, but sometimes it can all become too much. The external stimuli we experience every day extend far beyond what is natural. Compare life today to life as it was just before the advent of the internet, even back then people complained about the stresses of modern life. Nowadays, we have all our handheld smart devices, and technology is spreading like wildfire: Never before has mankind had so much technology at its disposal, but possibly to its peril.</span></p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:2em'><span style='font-family:Times New Roman'>42) ______________The human body is a finely tuned instrument, one which is self-sustaining for the most part, and instinctively knows when to rest. Classically, the human body possesses a sleep-wake cycle, known as our circadian rhythm. This simply refers to the rise and fall of specific hormones, based on the levels of natural light we are exposed to. Under ideal circumstances, this would make us wake up at around 5:30 AM, and go to bed between 6-9 PM. However, this can easily be manipulated, thanks to the influence of artificial light. Following the advent of artificial light sources (lamps, lightbulbs etc.), humans became able to modify the daily rhythms to sleep at a later hour, and conversely awaken later too. This is acceptable, except the fact that this alteration normally results in a sleep deficiency developing. As mankind progresses, it is only getting worse; cellphones are easily used long after you’ve hit the sack, and should be warming up to sleep.</span></p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:2em'><span style='font-family:Times New Roman'>43) ______________The likelihood of becoming a scholar is higher than ever now, thanks to the widespread availability to educational material, but at a cost. Though you may be able to maintain a high level of performance for a time, eventually your memory will start to fail owing to a lack of sleep, and gradually increased levels of stress. Everything requires a sacrifice, and attaining that degree may eventually cause you to lose an important part of what makes you, you.</span></p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:2em'><span style='font-family:Times New Roman'>44) ______________Being in love, or caring deeply about someone causes profound changes to your brain’s neurochemistry, boosting motivation, drive and analysis. However, technology may be causing us to lose some of the natural compensatory mechanism our brains have deigned to protect what we hold dear. Without lots of one-on-one time, your brain does not form as strong a level of connection with your significant other as it could. Opting for text messages, instead of building communication is a poor tool. When you are eventually faced with having deep conversations, the awkward silence may be the most visible indicator that something is truly messed up.</span></p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:2em'><span style='font-family:Times New Roman'>45) ______________Your brain is a beast at processing stimuli. However, even the most powerful processor can get bogged down when exposed to too much stimulation. With noise coming from all directions, glaring lights, and flashing signs all around us, the brain picks up everything and has to process it all. If you’ve tried working in a busy, noisy office, you probably found it hard to work at peak efficiency, and this is a symptom of the brain being overstimulated.</span></p><p><br/></p>

{% endraw %}

options:
Memory loss may occur.
The high-tech world may overstimulate our brain.
External stimuli may damage brain.
Relationships may lose meaning.
Brain processing may suffer.
There are negative actions on our daily rhythm.

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:2em'><span style='font-family:Times New Roman'>The opening and closing of doors are the most significant actions of man’s life. What a mystery lies in doors!</span></p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:2em'><span style='font-family:Times New Roman'>No man knows what awaits him when he opens a door. Even the most familiar room, where the clock ticks and the hearth glows red at dust, may harbor surprises. 46) __________________ The wise man opens his front door with humility and a spirit of acceptance. </span></p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:2em'><span style='font-family:Times New Roman'>Which one of us has not sat in some waiting room and watched the panels of a door that was full of meaning? 47) ______________________ You watched the confidential secretary go in and out, carelessly turning the heavy door which, to you, revolved on hinges of fate. And then the young woman said, “Mr. Cranberry will see you now.” As you grasped the knob the thought flashed, “When I open the door again, what will have happened?”</span></p><p style='text-indent:2em'><span style='font-size:16px'>There are many kinds of doors. 48) ______________________________ But the symbol and mystery of a door resides in its quality of concealment. The meaning of a door is to hide what lies inside; to keep the heart in suspense.</span></p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:2em'><span style='font-family:Times New Roman'>Also, there are many ways of opening doors. 49) __________________________________ The opening of doors is a mystic act: It has in it some flavor of the unknown and some sense of moving into a new moment. It includes the highest glimpse of mortal gladness: reunions, reconciliations, the joy of lovers long parted. Even in sadness, the opening of a door may bring relief: It changes and redistributes human forces. </span></p><p style='text-indent:2em'><span style='font-size:16px'>But the closing of doors is far more terrible. It is a confession of finality. Every door closed brings something to an end. And there are degrees of sadness in the closing of doors. A door slammed is a confession of weakness. A door gently shut is often the most tragic gesture in life. 50) ______________________________________</span></p><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:2em'><span style='font-family:Times New Roman'>The opening and closing of doors is a part of the stern fluency of life. Life will not stay still and let us alone. We are continually opening doors with hope, closing them with despair. Life lasts not much longer than a pipe of tobacco, and destiny knocks us out like the ashes.</span></p><p><br/></p>

{% endraw %}

options
A. In a residence, for example, doors may provide security to prevent unauthorized entrance into the residence, or a particular room thereof.
B. Perhaps you were waiting to apply for a job; perhaps you had some “deal” you were ambitious to put over. Or, you perhaps thought you would be fired when the boss comes through the door.
C. For instance, every one knows the seizure of anguish that comes just after the closing of a door, when the loved one is still near, within sound of voice, and yet already far away.
D. There is the cheery push of elbow with which the waiter shoves open the kitchen door when he bears in your tray of supper. There is the sympathetic and awful silence of the dentist’s assistant who opens the door into the clinic, and, without speaking, implies that the dentist is ready for you.
E. The plumber may actually have called (while you were out) and fixed that leaking faucet. The cook may have been nervous or anxious and demanded her passports, or the dog may have eaten the meat just prepared in the kitchen.
F. Revolving doors for hotels, shops, and public buildings, which are typical of the brisk, busy ways of modern life. And there are trapdoors, sliding doors, double doors, stage doors, prison doors, glass doors.
G. For example, in Alice in Wonderland, the door leads Alice to a whimsical world hidden behind the rabbit hole, while in The Chronicles of Narnia, the wardrobe door serves as a portal to the magical land of Narnia.
